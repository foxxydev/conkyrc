# conkyrc
Conky configuration to track CPU, RAM and storage of the linux device.

### Installing dependencies

This project relies on the conky-all package. Install it by running:

```
$ sudo apt-get install conky-all
```
### Adding the config

Once the package has been installed create a new file in your home directory:

```
$ nano ~/.conkyrc
```

Once the file was opened, copy-paste the code from conkyrc into that, eventually make changes if you don't like the colours or you have more/less cores.
